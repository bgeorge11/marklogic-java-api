Step 1: 
 Build dev source code by doing the following on your dev branch

Mvn clean
Mvn –Dmaven.test.skip=true install

Step2:
Go to the directory where you ../test-complete/

Gradlew clean

Gradlew test    => to run all the functional tests, which will take about couple of hours

gradlew -Dtest.single=TestBulkWriteMetadata1 test    => to run individual tests

each test is independent and you can find the results under Java-client-api-qa\build\test-results

and if you run all the functional tests then you can find a report under Java-client-api-qa\build\reports\tests\index.html
